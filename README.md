# Bioinformatics guide

This repository has a basic complete guide for bioinformaticians. To make some actions for instance,
understading how to manage biological data, the type of data that is handle and how to read it in python,
further, how to access novel databases and get data for more analysis such as BLAST and sequence aligment.
This project shows python libraries to create a professional environment for doing bioinformatics. Moreover, 
an interesting example with COVID-19 genome analysis. In order to run this project please follow the instructions
below.
  
## Installation guide
