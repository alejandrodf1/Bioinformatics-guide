What is the maximum similarity between sequence X and Y?\n","2. **Local alignment:** This method finds the most similar subsequences among the 2 sequences. What is the maximum similarity between a subsequence of X and a subsequence of Y?\n","\n","Moreover, when doing alignments, you can specify the match score and gap penalties.\n","\n","1. The **match score** indicates the compatibility between an alignment of two characters in the sequences. Highly compatible characters should be given **positive scores**, and incompatible ones should be given negative scores or 0.\n","\n","2. The **gap penalties** should be negative.\n","\n","## Biopython: Bio.pairwise2\n","Biopython includes two built-in pairwise aligners: Bio.pairwise2 module and PairwiseAligner class within the Bio.Align module (since Biopython version 1.72). Both can perform global and local alignments. -> **focus on pairwise2**\n","The names of the alignment functions in this module follow the convention alignmenttypeXY where alignmenttype is either “global” or “local” and XY is a 2 character code indicating the parameters it takes. The first character X indicates the parameters for matches (and mismatches), and the second Y indicates the parameters for gap penalties.\n","\n","**The match parameters are:**\n","\n","1. x - No parameters. Identical characters have score of 1, otherwise 0\n","\n","2. m - A match score is the score of identical chars, otherwise mismatch score. Keywords: match, mismatch\n","\n","3. d - A dictionary returns the score of any pair of characters. Keyword: match_dict\n","\n","4. c - A callback function returns scores. Keyword: match_fn\n","\n","**The gap penalty parameters are:**\n","\n","1. x - No gap penalties\n","2. s - Same open and extend gap penalties for both sequences. Keywords: open, extend\n","3. d - The sequences have different open and extend gap penalties. Keywords openA, extendA, openB, extendB\n","4. c - A callback function returns the gap penalties. Keywords gap_A_fn, gap_B_fn"],"metadata":{"id":"T-Iol9wOe81-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **For example: global alignment**\n","Just consider that for doing local alignment is the same
