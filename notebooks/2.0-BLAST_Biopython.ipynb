A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a subject protein or nucleotide sequence (called a query) with a library or database of sequences\n","\n","For example, following the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the mouse, a scientist will typically perform a BLAST search of the human genome to see if humans carry a similar gene; BLAST will identify sequences in the human genome that resemble the mouse gene based on similarity of sequence.\n","\n","Biopython provides Bio.Blast module to deal with NCBI BLAST operation. You can run BLAST in either local connection or over Internet connection.\n","\n","##Running queries against online version of BLAST\n","We use the function qblast() in the Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW module to call the online version of BLAST. This has three non-optional arguments:\n","\n","* The first argument is the blast program to use for the search, as a lower case string. Currently qblast only works with blastn, blastp, blastx, tblast and tblastx\n","* The second argument specifies the databases to search against \n","* The third argument is a string containing your query sequence. This can either be the sequence itself, the sequence in fasta format, or an identifier like a GI number\n","\n","API: https://ncbi.github.io/blast-cloud/dev/api.html\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4447,"status":"ok","timestamp":1666914548804,"user":{"displayName":"ALEJANDRO SEBASTIAN DELGADO FARIAS","userId":"15955727817166930026"},"user_tz":300},"id":"5aTK0sVgyMj-","outputId":"59b847f4-0b60-4f24-f2f9-8f0cf2ff9c2a"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: biopython in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (1.79)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from biopython) (1.21.6)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install biopython"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":32,"status":"ok","timestamp":1666914548807,"user":{"displayName":"ALEJANDRO SEBASTIAN DELGADO FARIAS","userId":"15955727817166930026"},"user_tz":300},"id":"kbsjeLqru-Ar","outputId":"fbed764a-8c91-4b7c-f1f7-3ee25f8592f2"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Help on function qblast in module Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW:\n","\n","qblast(program, database, sequence, url_base='https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi', auto_format=None, composition_based_statistics=None, db_genetic_code=None, endpoints=None, entrez_query='(none)', expect=10.0, filter=None, gapcosts=None, genetic_code=None, hitlist_size=50, i_thresh=None, layout=None, lcase_mask=None, matrix_name=None, nucl_penalty=None, nucl_reward=None, other_advanced=None, perc_ident=None, phi_pattern=None, query_file=None, query_believe_defline=None, query_from=None, query_to=None, searchsp_eff=None, service=None, threshold=None, ungapped_alignment=None, word_size=None, short_query=None, alignments=500, alignment_view=None, descriptions=500, entrez_links_new_window=None, expect_low=None, expect_high=None, format_entrez_query=None, format_object=None, format_type='XML', ncbi_gi=None, results_file=None, show_overview=None, megablast=None, template_type=None, template_length=None)\n","    BLAST search using NCBI's QBLAST server or a cloud service provider.\n","    \n","    Supports all parameters of the old qblast API for Put and Get.\n","    \n","    Please note that NCBI uses the new Common URL API for BLAST searches\n","    on the internet (http://ncbi.github.io/blast-cloud/dev/api.html).
